"things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of the "
"chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin "
"and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We’ll also show you "
"how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo "
"mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and "

"of every file for the history of the project is pulled down when you run "
"`git clone`. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can use any of "
"the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when "
